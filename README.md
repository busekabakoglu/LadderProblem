# CMPE 250 - Project 4
## LadderProblem  
In a grid map, there are numbers written in each cell which is the height of the cell. To go from one cell to another, one needs a ladder of length the difference between two cells. The main purpose of the project is calculating the total length of ladders needed for following a sequence of cells, in an efficient way, which must be the minimum length.
